# Web Scrapping Tools

This is intended to grow into a library of useful data scraping tools scripted in Python.

# Prerequisites

- [python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/)

## Requirements

- [git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)
  - You'll know you did it right if you can run `git --version` and you see a response like `git version x.x.x`

## Setup

Clone this repo

```
git clone https://github.com/thisrepo
cd <your project's file>
```

Then install dependencies

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Notes

These scripts have been created and tested on the Ubuntu 20.04.4 LTS operating system and Python 3.8.10

These scripts are mainly based on the ffmpeg and youtube-dl libraries. Please note that youtube-dl can be very slow for downloading (~50kb/s). The new yt-dlp library is a fork of youtube-dl and features improved performance (~5Mip/s downloads) and additionnal tools. More on these libraries in the links below.
